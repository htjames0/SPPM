Simple Stock Price Prediction Model

I am using TensorFlow's keras package in the Jupyter Notebook's environment to create and test a simple stock price prediction model.  Currently, I have code to use one input and output to create the network but plan on developing the network further.  An interest in this project would include physic's aided learning to help with training, although this topic is advanced and might require more research and background knowledge.
